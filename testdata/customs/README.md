Contains, for different cameras, custom settings files exported from X Raw Studio. Used for unit tests.
To support new cameras, create identical files with X Raw Studio. 
Make sure that unused settings are also set correctly. Custom settings always contain **all** setting values, regardless of the values themselves. Example: Temperature value for White Balance 'Auto'.
